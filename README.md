- Serving the frontend in production

### Frontend
The frontend is built with React and uses the following technologies:
- **React**: Core library for building the user interface
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing
- **Chakra UI**: For accessible and customizable UI components
- **React Icons**: For including icons in the application
- **Zustand**: For state management
- **Next Themes**: For implementing theme toggling
- **Vite**: For a fast development server and build tool

## Features
